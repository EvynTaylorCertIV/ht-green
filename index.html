                <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
                    super-efficient heat pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT
                    Green
                    work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed
                    to
                    wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>

                <img width="250" src="/images/geo250.jpg" alt="large piping with geothermal tower in the background">
                <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than the air and we can
                    use
                    this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free
                    plentiful home warming energy year-round.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has previously been
                    geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have
                    dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications
                    such as
                    home heating.
                    <br><br>
                    Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions
                    are
                    much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential
                    to
                    help mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.

                <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a wind turbine system that
                    generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you
                    increase
                    your energy generation potential.
